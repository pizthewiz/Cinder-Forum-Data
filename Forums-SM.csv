"Gallery","Uncategorised","Paleodictyon","paleodictyon","06-Mar-2013 03:06 PM PST","Hi Folks,<div><br></div><div>I'd like to share with you one of the last project I've been working on. Even if I've been using Cinder for several years now, I think I never posted here in the gallery! Cinder was used as our main tool in production for the first time here in a quite big project, so I thought it was important to say one more time how much Cinder rules!</div><div><br></div><div><a href=""http://www.antivj.com/paleodictyon/"" target=""_blank"">http://www.antivj.com/paleodictyon/</a></div><div><br></div><div>I originally wanted to make a long post here, but this post ended being way to long and way to illustrated to be on a forum so you can read about the process and the software&nbsp;development&nbsp;here:&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div><a href=""http://blog.antivj.com/2013/bacteria-farming-and-software-design/"" target=""_blank"">http://blog.antivj.com/2013/bacteria-farming-and-software-design/</a></div><div><br></div><div>I ported a small part of the original software to WebGl if you want to have a look: <a href=""http://www.antivj.com/paleodictyon_app"" target=""_blank"">http://www.antivj.com/paleodictyon_app</a> (you'll need a good computer, chrome and good bandwidth)</div><div><br></div><div>Thanks again to Andrew, all the team and the amazingly helpful people around here!</div>","simongeilfus","0","0"

"Gallery","Uncategorised","Paleodictyon","paleodictyon","06-Mar-2013 03:06 PM PST","Hey! Thank you all so much, I'm glad you liked it, it is always difficult to make proper documentation for that kind of project...<div><br></div><div>@sansumbrela: You'll be&nbsp;disappointed&nbsp;by how simple those modules were. I used contours detection for most ""objects"" and a good old getPixel for the others. No fancy CV functions here, would have make sense with the particles to try optical flow but didn't had time for that ... And well also it worked for me because most video footages were&nbsp;highly&nbsp;contrasted (read black and white polygons).</div><div><br></div><div>@ariel: (hehe, oui c'est bien moi, apr√®s 3-4 nuits blanches!) About the WebGL app, you're right, the funny thing is that I'm actually exactly doing what we do for the actual installation... using virtual projectors / cameras to project a video on the geometry. All the code is there if you are interested (it was ported from cinder)! About the AA, google disabled it two days after I started the project, so I'm using a combination of fxaa and a higher resolution render target. A bit expensive (especially the double resolution) but it works pretty well.</div><div><br></div><div>@rain2012: here you go: <a href='https://github.com/garrynewman/GWEN' target='_blank'>https://github.com/garrynewman/GWEN</a> (but don't expect finding a timeline or a nodegraph there!)</div><div><br></div><div>Thanks again! :)</div>","simongeilfus","0","0"

I think the fact that we could chose the service provider / technical team we were going to work with, gave us much more confidence. Our friends Lumens 8 worked with us for the technical (broadcasting?) side of the project, and their expertise definitely made the difference!<br></div><div><blockquote class=""block_quote""><span style=""font-family: arial, verdana, Helvetica, sans-serif; line-height: 22px; background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);"">You inspired me to give GWEN a try, it's pretty sweet.</span></blockquote>Yep, Gwen is quite nice. I had to hack it quite a lot to make those widgets possible, so I'm not sure I'm going to continue building on top of it... But I was actually thinking about cleaning what I already have and upload that to github ... ( In the meantime I can send you a zip with the Cinder Renderer )<br><br></div>","simongeilfus","0","0"
"Gallery","Uncategorised","Paleodictyon","paleodictyon","06-Mar-2013 03:06 PM PST","I would also appreciate if you released your GWEN modifications. I also got interested after reading your write-up, but it does not seem to be straightforward to make it work. I built the example with a couple of tweaks, but it crashes in libGl.<div><br></div><div>- Gabor</div><div><br></div>","gabor_papp","0","0"
